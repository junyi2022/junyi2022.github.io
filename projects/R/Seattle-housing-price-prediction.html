    <h5>Project description</h5>

    <p class="p-description">This project aims to build a machine learning model for single-family housing price prediction in Seattle, Washington using both the housing (structural characteristics) and spatial characteristics. The housing price used as the dependent variable in the model's preparation is extracted from King County's 2015 data, and multiple independent variables used in the model are from the City of Seattle Open Data Portal. The predicting model is generated by Junyi and Ziyi and this report is written by Junyi.</p>
