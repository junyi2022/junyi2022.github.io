    <h5>Project description</h5>

    <p class="p-description">This project is a regional planning project that includes the north part of the Arthur Kill River and land on both the New York and New Jersey sides. It focuses on the energy transition and energy resiliency while acknowledging the industrial, specifically petrochemical, history and existing wetland ecology of the site. This site has a long history of receiving waste from Manhattan for landfill; the project aims to propose a new material flow that makes future waste that originates from solar panels beneficial to the site through different recycled products.</p>
    <p class="p-description">The Arthur Kill shore has severe flooding issues, especially during storms. On the other hand, it also has multiple industrial infrastructures such as power plants, pipelines, and natural gas storage. The overlap between flooding and centralized energy infrastructure increases energy insecurity and points to the need for decentralized power sources. At the same time, New York City already proposed a 100% clean energy plan in 2040.</p>
    <p class="p-description">This project follows the NYC guidelines and chooses solar energy as the type of clean energy to focus on because solar panels are easier to install and can function at different scales: rooftop, community, and utility levels. Since solar energy is Direct Current, it has a two-mile distance limitation of local transference, which helps define the project's scope.</p>
    <p class="p-description">Besides, solar panels have a lifetime of about 35 years, and this project also deals with solar panel recycling. Currently, most solar panels are dumped into landfills after their end of life, but multiple startups discovered methods to recycle the solar panels and the recycling rate is very high. In this way, this project plans for the reuse of these recycled materials. Among them, glass is the main material that gets recycled, and the project proposed to reform this glass into three types: glass sand, glass sediment, and glass reef. Each glass type can be combine with different landforms to create new sediment for future ecology.</p>
